Teaching programming for kids with MIT App Inventor 2

### 1. Day
Short introduction

*How to use MIT App Inventor 2
*How to write short program
*How to connect MITaI2 to phone
*How to test the app
*What are the different UI elements
*Code it!
*What is a Layout?
*Test it!
*Let's write a game together: Simple Tennis Game
** Using Accelerometer as a controller for the bat
** Using a ball, EdgeReached and Bounce
** Random, if-then-else
** Coordinates, checking and setting
** Ball Heading, Enabled

### 2. Day
Refresher and Coding day

* Refresher with code examples based on the Tenis game. Who knows, what the code does?
(Uhm, nearly nobody. I was really disappointed, but fortunately, the third day was much-much better. Kids need time they had bever coded before!
And I tended to forget how much time did I spend with learning, so be patient)

* New game: Whack a Mole!
* Additional material: How to download images from the net and resize, crop them.

### 3. Day
Refresher and Coding day
(I planned to leave them more and more alone. At the third day's end there were two kids who could create new project and a fully usable app alone!)

* 10 interesting code example.
Try to guess what it does alone! Than write a small app to test your theory! Check again the code!
There was a girl, who stopped at a code example and started to play with it. I was very happy.

* Let's code, Write a Whack a mole together!
They created a desing in a minute, downloaded and edited images, ok, they needed help with resizing and crop, and somebody noticed that if a picture
is transparent, the game will be more professional-looking.
So we needed to create transparent images, but paint was not helpful enough and the PCs were locked (downloading and installing were forbidden)

### 4. day
Refresh the codes from Whack-a-mole and Tennis.
I planned a Western game, which could be coded based on Whack-amole and tennis, and they could do it with light supervising.

I showed how to create sound for shooting to one of them, and the knowledge spreaded at the speed of light without me!
The started to shooting to each other with the mobile phones, it was fun.

Then a piano game for the best student, and everybody wanted to create her/his own piano program!

I showed them App Inventor Gallery and they were very keen. I would not think how they were amazed with sharing their apps and waiting for others to
 download it and liked it! Social media is really a motivating thing.

I also showed them how to install the apps onto their phone, but the PCs were locked, so connecting to them via USB was forbidden. I downloaded the apps
with my laptop.

Homework was to plan a game for the next lesson.

### Last day
Everybody got a plan for a game! So everybody did their homework! And every idea was good. I planned to speak about  coding,
but they did not need it. After listening to everybody's idea, they started to work on the design than the code.

During this I tried to code the hardest pieces, but I had to help with the smallest student (3. grade) and gave him some easy tasks
which suited to his age. But apart from him, everybody could code. Some of them totally alone. And he was also very motivated and very happy
to show his games to his father at home. He had no laptop/PC at home (which is a good thing, I think, because he had a football and this is what a boy in
his age needed).

At the end I gave a certificate to everybody. Maybe it was unnecessary, I did not think it ahead, so printing was in a hurry.
